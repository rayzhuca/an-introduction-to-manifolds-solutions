# Solutions to _An Introduction to Manifolds_

This is my solutions to _An Introduction to Manifolds_ by Loring W. Tu, second edition.

The purpose of this is not to be a comprehensive solutions guide. Rather, this was
made for myself to practice proof writing. Therefore, many of the exercises may be skipped.
I plan on only writing out about 2-3 exercises per section.

Feel free to contribute or point out any mistakes.
